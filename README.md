### AI_Tower_Defense
Artificial Intelligence Project PSU 2019 AI Tower Defense Game

### Mac Setup
Install the following packages:
* pygame
* joblib
* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* numpy
Example using pip3: `pip3 install pygame`

Performance Note: If using latest mac OSX Mojave, you must have the latest version of python installed or graphics will not render.
I'm currently using `3.7.3` and it works great.

### Run the game
Simply run `python3 main.py` located in the `AI_Tower_Defense/src/` directory.
See main.py to change the game mode. For example, set `GAME_MODE = MODE.manual` to play the game manually.
